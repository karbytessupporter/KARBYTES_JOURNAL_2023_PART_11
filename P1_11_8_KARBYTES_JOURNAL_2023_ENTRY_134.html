<p>I was recently looking at some Instagram posts in which spiritual gurus were having a discussion about the significance of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christian allegory</a> of Jesus being slaughtered in order to pay for all of humanity&#8217;s sins such that all humans (or at least the humans who vow to believe that the allegory is true and that only by believing that the allegory is true and saying a prayer asking for Jesus&#8217; gift of salvation) will be saved from going to Hell (where they would presumably spend eternity being tortured as punishment for not doing what God wants) and, instead, be whisked away to Heaven (where they would presumably spend eternity having a blissful orgasm pertaining to worshiping God). One of the gurus suggested that Christianity exemplifies making suffering a virtue and a prerequisite to humans experiencing a sense of meaning in life (and that, without suffering, life for humans is a meaningless experience).</p>
<p>I was thinking about how some people seem to think that suffering is necessary and therefore mandatory as I was walking today. I was having a conversation with an imaginary human character who did not want to suffer in order to have nice things in life such as material assets, advanced knowledge, a physically fit physique, and a sense of accomplishment. The imaginary person (named X) said that it wanted those nice things without having to suffer in order to attain those nice things. I told X, &#8220;In order to attain those goals within the confines of our physical universe, you would have to exert some degree of effort over some period of time while not knowing for sure whether your efforts would result in you getting what you want when you expect to get it. In other words, you would have to be willing to experience the discomfort of having to exert yourself physically and mentally and to contend with the fact that your future is uncertain in order to achieve your goals (and such goals are not attainable automatically).&#8221; X said that it wanted to attain its goals automatically without having to spend any time or energy doing so and with 100% certainty that it would get the outcome it wants. I told X that I would turn into a magical genie who would bend the laws of physics in order to give X what it wants. I then said, &#8220;Okay. Now all you have to do is tell me exactly what you want (and I will help you define your terms so that you do not end up screwing yourself over with faulty logic and misinformation). Once we draft your blueprint for your ideal life, I will wave my hand over it and, poof, it will instantly be implemented. Are you ready?&#8221; X got upset and said that it did not want to have to go through all that labor of having to articulate what it wants out of life. I offered to draft up the blueprint myself so that X could rest on its laurels while I did all the work. X complained that it did not trust me to draft a blueprint that would be exactly to X&#8217;s liking. I offered to run a brain scan on X which would tell me what X&#8217;s subconscious and conscious desires are with 100% accuracy and completeness and then feed those results into a machine whose output would be the most perfect blueprint of X&#8217;s ideal life possible. X reluctantly said okay. When I did what X wanted, X ended up right where X is without any changes being made to X&#8217;s life other than the fact that time continued to tick forward and physical laws appeared to continue operating as consistently as they were before I created X&#8217;s blueprint and executed its instructions. I said to X that what X wanted was what X already was and is (because any other possibility was not already selected by X before X instantiated into this physical universe as X before X was born and while X was still in God mode). So it appears that X wanted to suffer and to experience ambivalence and disappointment and other human experiences. Otherwise X would have instantiated into a different universe as a different kind of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a>.</p>
<p>The significance of what I have written is that I think that, deep down, any people who appear to be in my reality (myself included) are assumed to be in that reality because we subconsciously (or consciously) chose to instantiate into this instance and not some other instance (and there are presumably as many different types of instances as God can imagine (which means that there are basically infinitely many different permutations of reality which can be experienced)). This means that apologies are fundamentally insincere because people only ever do what they actually want to do at all times. Therefore, forgiveness is just as superfluous as is saying sorry. Rather than fret over which behaviors are morally correct and incorrect, I would rather assume that whatever happens to me is exactly what I wanted. Therefore, nothing which happens to me is morally wrong (given that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I define to be morally correct</a> is whatever I most want).</p>
