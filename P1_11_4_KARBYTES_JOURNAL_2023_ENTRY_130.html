<p>Update: As I was walking towards my house and was approximately twenty feet away from it, I saw a little animal running from the shadows and into the light. It was my tortoise shell cat named Brea excitedly coming up to greet me. She stood up on her hind legs to press her head against my hand affectionately and she rolled around happily near my feet. I stopped to pet her for a bit before proceeding to go inside the house. Now I am in the house sitting on the toilet as I make this update. <span style="background:#00ff00">I would like to say that it might be a waste of my time and money to do my showering, laundry, and mail receiving outside the house and that it is probably most cost effective for me to go home to use the washing machine, dryer, shower, and mailbox at least once per week.</span> One of the main reasons why I spend as little time at that house (and in Castro Valley) as possible is because the police (who use some kind of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stealth brain-to-computer interface</a> to read my thoughts and to forcibly project content into my auditory and sometimes visual field) seem to bombard me with messages I find extremely uncomfortable to put up with while I am in that area. Depending on what I am thinking about and where I am located, I hear various messages from those police. It seems that whenever I am near where my parents&#8217; houses are (which is the area I grew up in), the police bully me with messages that I deserve to be talked down to, ignored, censored, and treated like a wayward child who is not expected nor supported to have a life outside of being locked away in a mental hospital. I think it is a way of &#8220;softly evicting&#8221; me so that I stay away from this town because I am no longer welcome here (and perhaps I never really was). Also, <span style="background:#ffff00">when I said earlier that I think that people are being forced to work for pay and to not be able to afford living alone in their own apartments or households for one, I think that is to prevent people from being able to break out of the contrived role play games which are supposed to make them too complacent and distracted to question the status quo and to do things which enable them to not be so deprived of space and time to think deeply and to analyze the way things are (because such introspection is a threat to the status quo of most people having to be perpetually busy and within almost constant oversight of other human beings within close proximity of them to ensure that their thought s do not wander into subject matter which is not conducive to keeping everyone used to being sleep deprived, under educated, under exercised, accustomed to eating unhealthily and while dismissing the welfare of the animals they pay to have raised in captivity and often slaughtered, and resigned to postpone taking climate change as seriously as they probably would if they were honest and adequately informed).</span>  (Finally, I rarely go home because the Internet and mobile phone services up here are very weak and not conducive to even the simplest Internet based tasks).</p>

<p>Over the past 24 hours I have been thinking about whether or not to update the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEOLOGY</a> page of my primary website to include a paragraph which broaches the concept of a &#8220;hive mind&#8221; which is able to simultaneously experience multiple first-person frames of reference and, also, the concept of &#8220;consensus reality&#8221;. I have also been thinking about more pragmatic issues.</p>
<p>Firstly, I have been thinking that this is probably the first week I will not end up spending all of my ~$300 weekly paycheck. I feel the need to save as much money as possible and pretend that, sooner or later, my mom will stop being able or willing to give me money (so that I stop being so dependent on someone other than myself for financial security). I do not think it is worth my money to rent a motel room. Instead, I might just apply for a gym membership at Planet Fitness for approximately $10 per month so that I can go there to take a weekly shower (and use the nearby laundry mat to do my laundry) in the Laurel District of Oakland where I used to visit my second boyfriend Alan (and that area is about an hour&#8217;s walk from the Fruitvale BART station). Finally, if I want to keep receiving mail, I will probably have to rent a Post Office box (which means I will have to make an appointment to go to DMV to get a new driver&#8217;s license and likely I will have to have it mailed to my dad&#8217;s house). Then and only then will I have the requisite documents necessary to prove that I have a legal address so that I can rent a public mailbox. It seems like a lot of work just to not have to use my parent&#8217;s houses to get by, but I think it might be worth it. In the mean time, I will try to rely on my family or origin as little as possible. Today I plan on walking to my dad&#8217;s house to take my birth certificate and social security card out of my room and to put those documents in my backpack instead (for my peace of mind).</p>
<p>Finally, I am getting used to living in public and mostly outdoors. It does seem like &#8220;cheating&#8221; the societal game which seems to implicitly require that all adults pay rent for a housing unit and pay for the cost of relying on a car to get to work (and people who do not qualify for government financial aid are implicitly required to spend most of their waking hours working for pay so that those people do not become too introverted and too cut off from having to be relevant and useful to people other than their family of origin).</p>
<p>What I said in the previous paragraph is what I think is the real reason automation of jobs has not been more prevalent and why innovation to make the average standard of living higher has not been faster. <span style="background:#ffff00">I have heard that there are more than enough material resources and real estate to go around such that all humans could be housed and have access to basic resources such as food, transportation (at least by self-driving taxis), medical care, Internet access, and money or vouchers to buy miscellaneous commodities such as clothes, electronics, sports equipment, books, et cetera. So why is not every adult receiving an unconditional basic income of approximately $5,000 each month? If they did, they might not spend as much money because they have a comfortable, safe, and private place to hang out where they can get most of their entertainment, educational, and white collar (i.e. &#8220;work from anywhere&#8221; Internet-based) employment needs met.</span> I think that society is trying to remain sufficiently old fashioned and blue collar so that people are forced to interact with people who would otherwise be strangers they have no obligation to care about.</p>
<p>(I have decided to update that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEOLOGY</a> page as I said I would).</p>
