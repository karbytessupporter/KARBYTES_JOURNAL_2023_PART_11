<p>Over the past 24 hours I have been thinking about whether or not to update the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEOLOGY</a> page of my primary website to include a paragraph which broaches the concept of a &#8220;hive mind&#8221; which is able to simultaneously experience multiple first-person frames of reference and, also, the concept of &#8220;consensus reality&#8221;. I have also been thinking about more pragmatic issues.</p>
<p>Firstly, I have been thinking that this is probably the first week I will not end up spending all of my ~$300 weekly paycheck. I feel the need to save as much money as possible and pretend that, sooner or later, my mom will stop being able or willing to give me money (so that I stop being so dependent on someone other than myself for financial security). I do not think it is worth my money to rent a motel room. Instead, I might just apply for a gym membership at Planet Fitness for approximately $10 per month so that I can go there to take a weekly shower (and use the nearby laundry mat to do my laundry) in the Laurel District of Oakland where I used to visit my second boyfriend Alan (and that area is about an hour&#8217;s walk from the Fruitvale BART station). Finally, if I want to keep receiving mail, I will probably have to rent a Post Office box (which means I will have to make an appointment to go to DMV to get a new driver&#8217;s license and likely I will have to have it mailed to my dad&#8217;s house). Then and only then will I have the requisite documents necessary to prove that I have a legal address so that I can rent a public mailbox. It seems like a lot of work just to not have to use my parent&#8217;s houses to get by, but I think it might be worth it. In the mean time, I will try to rely on my family or origin as little as possible. Today I plan on walking to my dad&#8217;s house to take my birth certificate and social security card out of my room and to put those documents in my backpack instead (for my peace of mind).</p>
<p>Finally, I am getting used to living in public and mostly outdoors. It does seem like &#8220;cheating&#8221; the societal game which seems to implicitly require that all adults pay rent for a housing unit and pay for the cost of relying on a car to get to work (and people who do not qualify for government financial aid are implicitly required to spend most of their waking hours working for pay so that those people do not become too introverted and too cut off from having to be relevant and useful to people other than their family of origin).</p>
<p>What I said in the previous paragraph is what I think is the real reason automation of jobs has not been more prevalent and why innovation to make the average standard of living higher has not been faster. <span style="background:#ffff00">I have heard that there are more than enough material resources and real estate to go around such that all humans could be housed and have access to basic resources such as food, transportation (at least by self-driving taxis), medical care, Internet access, and money or vouchers to buy miscellaneous commodities such as clothes, electronics, sports equipment, books, et cetera. So why is not every adult receiving an unconditional basic income of approximately $5,000 each month? If they did, they might not spend as much money because they have a comfortable, safe, and private place to hang out where they can get most of their entertainment, educational, and white collar (i.e. &#8220;work from anywhere&#8221; Internet-based) employment needs met.</span> I think that society is trying to remain sufficiently old fashioned and blue collar so that people are forced to interact with people who would otherwise be strangers they have no obligation to care about.</p>
<p>(I have decided to update that <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/ideology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IDEOLOGY</a> page as I said I would).</p>
